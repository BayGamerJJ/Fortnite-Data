### To make it work:

You will need mongodb installed and a mongodb cluster, get your own for free [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_source=vscode&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=VS%20code%20extension)

Put your token in `config.json` file and other required data in `values.json`

Sorry for the bad organization, i didn't plan from the beginning to make it open source xD
